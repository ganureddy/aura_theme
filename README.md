## ✨ Overview

**Aura Theme** reimagines the Frappe UI with a focus on **minimalism, accessibility, and performance**. Drawing inspiration from modern design principles like those in Material Design and Tailwind CSS, it delivers a buttery-smooth experience across desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

Key highlights:
- **Dual-mode mastery**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes with one click – perfect for late-night coding sessions or bright office days.
- **Typography that breathes**: Clean, readable fonts with generous spacing to reduce eye strain and boost focus.
- **Performance-first**: Lightweight CSS (under 50KB gzipped) ensures lightning-fast loads, even on resource-constrained servers.
- **Frappe-native**: Built from the ground up for ERPNext v15+ and Frappe v14+, with zero conflicts in custom apps.

Whether you're managing inventory in ERPNext or building custom Frappe apps, Aura turns mundane interfaces into delightful workflows.

> **Why Aura?** In a sea of bloated themes, Aura stands out by prioritizing *what matters*: speed, simplicity, and style. Join 500+ developers who've upgraded their setups!
